## 2. Associate WML instance

For some types of assets, you must associate the IBM Watson Machine Learning service with the project. You are prompted to associate the IBM Watson Machine Learning the first time you open tools like Prompt Lab, AutoAI and etc.

Let’s add Watson Machine Learning service to a project directly.
- Go to Manage > Services & Integrations > IBM Services section.

## 3. Collaborate with other users

Collaborators are the people you add to the project to work together. After you create a project, add collaborators to share knowledge and resources freely, shift workloads flexibly, and help one another complete jobs.

You can add members of your IBM Cloud account as collaborators.

In the `Access Control` section of the project, you have option to add `Collaborators`.
